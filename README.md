# Json_parser in C 

This is a Json parser create from scratch, only using the `malloc()` and `free()` functions from the C librairie.
I made it as I can use a proper and common data structure in my Epitech's projects.

##USAGE 

####>to get the json in a structured linked list:

```C
obj_t *json_parser(char *json_to_open);
```
